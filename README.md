# Fintech Workshop 2018

We'll be building, no *modifying*, a stripped Bootstrap template.
Since this is a hackathon, we are building demos that should show the essence of our idea in the simplest way possible.
The tech doesn't have to be professional quality but it should help illustrate a larger idea.

This tech demo will focus on showing you how to build simple widgets, which are like embeddable chunks of function.
Many people provide widgets for free!

This demo will teach you how to use them, _not use them_! Use widgets sparingly, and with purpose.
Nobody wants to see a demo of meaningless widgets shoved onto a website. You'll also have to be careful about how
widgets are styled. It's easy to jumble together too many widgets, each with their own unique style.


## Advanced
You'll need Node and NPM installed on your computer and some basic command line knowledge.

We're going to build our own widgets using Web Components, specifically with the [Polymer Library](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/start/quick-tour).

Run in the project directory:
```
npm install --global polyserve
polyserve public # or npm run start
```

Then navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8081/` in your browser of choice. All changes should be visible here when you save
your code and refresh the browser.
