# Fintech Workshop 2018

We'll be building, no *modifying*, a stripped Bootstrap template.
Since this is a hackathon, we are building demos that should show the essence of our idea in the simplest way possible.
The tech doesn't have to be professional quality but it should help illustrate a larger idea.

This tech demo will focus on showing you how to build simple widgets, which are like embeddable chunks of function.
Many people provide widgets for free!

This demo will teach you how to use them, _not use them_! Use widgets sparingly, and with purpose.
Nobody wants to see a demo of meaningless widgets shoved onto a website.
